# v0.93
1. Fix issue with upnpc-script when IPv6 active in client
2. Smoke-scripts now has proper logging
3. Firewall now more permissive
4. Syslog now disabled externally. Also fixed darkstat logrotation issue.

# v0.94
1. iperf3 scripts synced

# v0.95
1. Backoff-timer f√∂r iperf3tcp scripts

# v0.96
1. UDP Iperf3 bidirectional,us/ds scripts. 
2. Optimized multi daemon compability for all iperf3 daemons

# v0.96.2
1. Synced all scripts

# v0.96.3
1. syslog configuration and installation added

# v0.96.4
1. All iperf3 scripts now have full support for WiFi link statistics. Should work for most non-broadcom cards under linux.

# v0.96.5
1. logrotate for all chprobe logs.
2. Fix issue for vht/ht parsings when STA switches between radios (2.4 and 5ghz)

# v0.96.6
1. Added bbk_cli test (bredbandskollen)

# v0.96.7
1. Added backoff mechanisms for iperf3tcp and bbk scripts (to avoid collisions).

# v0.96.8
1. New anti-collision methods for almost all scripts
2. Added HTTPS/HTTP/DNS probes in a merged script

# v0.96.9
1. Force IPv4 on all tests for now. Until IPv6 is fully supported.
2. Introduced dynamic window size (and omit 2 seconds of TCP test) instead of starting with 1MB size like before. Due to issues with newer iperf3 versions (3.1.6+).
3. Increased anti-collision window (amount of PIDs allowed to run) due long-lived to UDP tests being killed.
